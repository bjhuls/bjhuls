👋 Hi, I’m BJ Huls
- 👀 I’m looking to go to law school soon!
- Currently a Software Developer for NISC
- 💞️ I’m interested in data science & automation for creative problem solving
- 📫 [How to reach me](https://bjhuls.com/)

(I just made a new account on my personal email, [my old github account](https://github.com/williamhuls) was on my undergrad email and I no longer have access to it, hence the lack of projects)
